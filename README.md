## Schedo

# A simple todo list app built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Going through my old system when i found this project, after two years or more.

I remember i planned to write it all whole in vanilla javascript but i ended up adding some Jquery.

To understand the steps taken before i got to where the app is now,
I'll reference [Max Sandelin](https://github.com/themaxsandelin/todo) Todo tutorial

It's a very long project. I didn't review before pushing online [Schedo](https://adescode.github.io/schedo/), but i'm ready to help if anyone is stuck.
